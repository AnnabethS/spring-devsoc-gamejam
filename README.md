Attempting to do this in not that long, in SDL2 and C only.

## How to build

Make sure you have the dependencies listed in `DEPENDENCIES`

run `make` in the project root

## How to play

The game has no tutorial in it right now, so here are some instructions:

- Your goal is to reach the dog, and bring him back to your ship
- Do this by firing your gun to affect your trajectory
- You have limited bullets (displayed in the top left)
- Remember that you are firing a gun to move, so be careful not to hit
anything important (your dog)

### Controls

- Aim with the mouse
- `Left Click` to shoot
- `Right Click` to slow time
- `R` to restart the level at any time
- `Esc` to quit to menu, or quit the game on the menu screen
- `Q` to quit the game entirely
